NAME
    Class::Accessor::Lite - a minimalistic variant of Class::Accessor

SYNOPSIS
        package MyPackage;

        use Class::Accessor::Lite (
            new => 1,
            rw  => [ qw(foo bar) ],
            ro  => [ qw(baz) ],
            wo  => [ qw(hoge) ],
        );

DESCRIPTION
    The module is a variant of "Class::Accessor". It is fast and requires
    less typing, has no dependencies to other modules, and does not mess up
    the @ISA.

THE USE STATEMENT
    The use statement (i.e. the "import" function) of the module takes a
    single hash as an argument that specifies the types and the names of the
    properties. Recognises the following keys.

    new => $true_or_false
        the default constructor is created if the value evaluates to true,
        otherwise nothing is done (the default behaviour)

    rw => \@name_of_the_properties
        creates a read / write accessor for the name of the properties
        passed through as an arrayref

    ro => \@name_of_the_properties
        creates a read-only accessor for the name of the properties passed
        through as an arrayref

    wo => \@name_of_the_properties
        creates a write-only accessor for the name of the properties passed
        through as an arrayref

    For more detailed explanation read the following section describing the
    behaviour of each function that actually creates the accessors.

FUNCTIONS
    As of version 0.04 the properties can be specified as the arguments to
    the "use" statement (as can be seen in the SYNOPSIS) which is now the
    recommended way of using the module, but for compatibility the following
    functions are provided as well.

  Class::Accessor::Lite->mk_accessors(@name_of_the_properties)
    Creates an accessor in current package under the name specified by the
    arguments that access the properties (of a hashref) with the same name.

  Class::Accessor::Lite->mk_ro_accessors(@name_of_the_properties)
    Same as mk_accessors() except it will generate read-only accessors (i.e.
    true accessors). If you attempt to set a value with these accessors it
    will throw an exception.

  Class::Accessor::Lite->mk_wo_accessors(@name_of_the_properties)
    Same as mk_accessors() except it will generate write-only accessors
    (i.e. mutators). If you attempt to read a value with these accessors it
    will throw an exception.

  Class::Accessor::Lite->mk_new()
    Creates the "new" function that accepts a hash or a hashref as the
    initial properties of the object.

  Class::Accessor::Lite->mk_new_and_accessors(@name_of_the_properties)
    DEPRECATED. Use the new "use Class::Accessor::Lite (...)" style.

FAQ
  Can I use "Class::Accessor::Lite" in an inherited module?
    Yes in most cases, when the class object in the super class is
    implemented using a hashref. However you _should_ _not_ create the
    constructor for the inherited class by calling
    "<Class::Accessor::Lite-"new()>> or by "<use Class::Accessor::Lite (new
    =" 1)>>. The only other thing that "Class::Accessor::Lite" does is to
    set up the accessor functions for given property names through a blessed
    hashref.

  What happens when passing more than one arguments to the accessor?
    When the accessor built by Class::Accessor::Lite is given more than one
    arguments, a reference to the arguments will be saved as an arrayref.
    This behaviour might not be necessary but is implemented as is to
    maintain compatibility with Class::Accessor::Fast.

        my @data = (1, 2, 3);
        $obj->someproperty(@data);

        $obj->someproperty->[2]++; # $data[3] is incremented

    In general, you should pass an arrayref to set an arrayref to a
    property.

        my @data = (1, 2, 3);
        $obj->someproperty([ @data ]); # save a copy using arrayref

        $obj->someproper->[2]++; # @data is not modified
